#                        MySQL Notes
######################################################################
#TODO I think some of these notes should be elsewhere
# A Note about the database structure expected
#   Each LBD database is expected to have:
#   PreCutoff_N11
#   PostCutoff_N11
#   PreCutoff_Implicit
#
# Both PreCutoff_N11 and PostCutoff_N11 should
# be generated manually using CUI_Collector
# PreCutoff_Implicit is generated using the tableToSparseMatrix
# function here, which exports a sparse matrix. That matrix 
# can then be imported into matlab, squared, and reloaded into
# a mysql database. With these 3 tables LBD can be performed

#                          Description
######################################################################
# Discovery.pm - provides matrix operations from  n11 counts from 
# UMLS::Association
#
#TODO I think some of these notes should be elsewhere
# 'B' term filtering may be applied by removing elements from the 
# explicit knowledge matrix before squaring. It is important to 
# replicate the original matrix before filtering so that explicit 
# knowledge can be removed from the implicit matrix.
# 'C' term filtering may be applied directly to the implicit
# knowledge matrix.
#
# A Typical workflow may look like:
# 1) load explicit knowledge from UMLS::Association
# 2) clone explicit knowledge (for removal from implicit)
# 3) apply filtering to explicit knowledge
# 4) square explicit knowledge to generate implicit knowledge
# 5) remove explicit knowledge from implicit knowledge
# 6) filter impicit knowledge
# 
# which has code as:
# TODO insert sample code

#NOTE: CUI merging/term expansion can also be easily done by adding
#   two or more explicit vectors, then generating explicit knowledge from
#   them.  BUT also interesting is that term expansion, etc... is 
#   unnecassary if we just rank against every term. We may however need 
#   to modify the ranking metrics to account for synonyms, etc.. (max value
#   of a set of synonyms or something)

#NOTE...this is calculating B*A ... but is that appropriate?  ... I think that it is, but the values are maybe not so appropriate    ... B*A is nice because it makes the implicit matrix not keep track of non-starting cui rows.   ...but the values are pretty much meaninigless when I do it that way...so If I care about the values I should multiply A*A  ... or maybe B*A ... its something I'd have to really think about  ...anyway If I do any method but this, I would want to eliminate rows after multiplication

# finds the implicit connections for all CUIs (based on squaring)
# It does this by multiplying $matrixB*$matrixA. If $matrix B is the starting
# matrix, and $matrixA is the explicitMatrix, this method works correctly and
# efficiently. $matrixA and $matrixB may also be the explicit matrix but
# this is more inefficient.
