=head1 NAME

UMLS-Association README

=head2 SYNOPSIS

  This package consists of Perl modules along with supporting Perl
  programs that calculate the association between CUI pairs using 
  frequency information from the Metamapped Medline baseline. 

  UMLS::Association requires the Text::NSP module to calculate the 
  association measures. Text::NSP currently implements the following 
  measures for bigrams: 

  UMLS::Association requires the UMLS::Interface module to access 
  the Unified Medical Language System (UMLS) to map input terms 
  to Concept Unique Identifiers (CUIs) and provide additional 
  information. 

  The following sections describe the organization of this software
  package and how to use it. A few typical examples are given to help
  clearly understand the usage of the modules and the supporting
  utilities.

=head2 INSTALL

To install the module, run the following magic commands:

  perl Makefile.PL
  make
  make test
  make install

This will install the module in the standard location. You will, most
probably, require root privileges to install in standard system
directories. To install in a non-standard directory, specify a prefix
during the 'perl Makefile.PL' stage as:

  perl Makefile.PL PREFIX=/home/programs

It is possible to modify other parameters during installation. The
details of these can be found in the ExtUtils::MakeMaker
documentation. However, it is highly recommended not messing around
with other parameters, unless you know what you're doing.

=head2 DATABASE SETUP

UMLS-Association assumes that the CUI bigrams extracted from the Metamapped
Medline baseline is present as a mysql database. The names of these databases 
can be passed as configuration options at initialization. However, if the 
names of the database is not provided at initialization, then default values 
are used -- the database is called CUI_BIGRAMS and contains four tables: 
	1. N_11
	2. N_1P
	3. N_P1
	4. N_PP

Direction on installing the CUI_BIGRAMS database is in the INSTALL file. 

All other tables in the databases will be ignored, and any of these
tables missing would raise an error.

The mysql server can be on the same machine as the module or could
be on a remotely accessible machine. The location of the server can
be provided during initialization of the module.

=head2 INITIALIZING THE MODULE

To create an instance of the UMLS-Association object, using default values for
all configuration options:

  use UMLS::Association;
  my $association = UMLS::Association->new();

The following configuration options are also provided though:

    'driver'       -> Default value 'mysql'. This option specifies the 
                      Perl DBD driver that should be used to access the
                      database. This implies that the some other DBMS
                      system (such as PostgresSQL) could also be used,
                      as long as there exist Perl DBD drivers to
                      access the database.
    'database'     -> Default value 'CUI_BIGRAMS'. This option specifies 
                      the name UMLS-Association database. 
    'hostname'     -> Default value 'localhost'. The name or the IP 
                      address of the machine on which the database 
		      server is running.
    'socket'       -> Default value '/tmp/mysql.sock'. The socket on 
                      which the database server is using.
    'port'         -> The port number on which the database server 
                      accepts connections.
    'username'     -> Username to use to connect to the database server. 
                      If not provided, the module attempts to connect as 
                      an anonymous user.
    'password'     -> Password for access to the database server. If not
                      provided, the module attempts to access the server
                      without a password.

These are passed through a hash. For example:

    my %options = ();
    $options{'config'}   = $config;
    $options{'database'} = 'CUI_BIGRAM_V1';

    my $association = UMLS::Association->new(\%options);

Keep in mind that the database configuration options can be 
included in the MySQL my.cnf file. This is preferable. The 
directions for this are in the INSTALL file. 

=head2 CONTENTS

    All the modules that will be installed in the Perl system directory are
    present in the '/lib' directory tree of the package. 

    The package contains a utils/ directory that contain Perl utility 
    programs. These utilities use the modules or provide some supporting
    functionality.

      umls-association.pl         -- returns the association score of two 
		                    terms or UMLS CUIs given a specified 
		                    measure (and view of the UMLS).

     CUICollector.pl		-- script to create the CUI_BIGRAM database
                                   from the Metamapped Medline Baseline 

    The package also contains a Apache Hadoop MapReduce java implementation
    of CUICollector.pl named CUICollectorMapReduce in the '/Hadoop' directory.
    Refer to the README file in the '/Hadoop' directory for installation and
    running instructions.
