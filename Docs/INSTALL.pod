assocLBD Installation Guide

=head1 TESTING PLATFORMS

assocLBD has been developed and tested on Linux primarily using Perl.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 perl Makefile.PL

 make

 make test

 make install
 
=head1 DESCRIPTION

assocLBD provides a system for performing ABC co-occurrence literature based discovery using a variety of options, and association-based ranking methods

=head1 REQUIREMENTS

assocLBD REQUIRES that the following software packages and data:

=head2 Programming Languages
     Perl (version 5.16.3 or better)

=head2 CPAN Modules
     UMLS::Association
     UMLS::Interface
     
=head2 Required for some Methods:
     MATLAB
     MySQL (version 5 or better)  

=head1 INSTALLATION STAGES

=over

=item The installation is broken into four stages:
=item Stage 1: Install Programming Languages
                  If already installed you need at minimum: 
                      - Perl version 5.16.3 or better

=item Stage 2: Install CPAN Modules
=item Stage 3: Install assocLBD
=item Stage 4: Create an co-occurrence matrix

=back 

=head2 Stage 1: Install Programming Languages, if already installed go to Stage 2

Perl (version 5.16.3 or better)
Perl is freely available at <http://www.perl.org>. It is very likely that you will already have Perl installed if you are using a Unix/Linux based system.

=head2 Stage 2 - Install CPAN modules, if already installed go to Stage 3

If you have supervisor access, or have configured MCPAN for local install, you can install each of these via:

     perl -MCPAN -e shell
     > install <packageName>

=head3 UMLS::Interface

The core UMLS package provides a dictionary from content unqiue identifiers (CUI) to their meanings in the Unified Medical Language System. Refer to the UMLS::Interface documentation for how to install the UMLS database on your system.

The package is freely available at:
<http://search.cpan.org/dist/UMLS-Interface/>

=head3 UMLS::Association
Use to calculate association scores used in most of the ranking methods
  
The package is freely available at:

=head2 Stage 3: Install assocLBD package
The usual way to install the package is to run the following commands:

perl Makefile.PL
make
make test
make install

You will often need root access/superuser privileges to run make install. The module can also be installed locally. To do a local install, you need to specify a PREFIX option when you run 'perl Makefile.PL'. For example,

perl Makefile.PL PREFIX=/home

or

perl Makefile.PL LIB=/home/lib PREFIX=/home

will install UMLS-Interface into /home. The first method above will install the modules in /home/lib/perl5/site_perl/5.16.3 (assuming you are using version 5.16.3 of Perl; otherwise, the directory will be slightly different). The second method will install the modules in /home/lib. In either case the executable scripts will be installed in /home/bin and the man pages will be installed in home/share.

Warning: do not put a dash or hyphen in front of PREFIX, or LIB

In your perl programs that you may write using the modules, you may need to add a line like so

use lib '/home/lib/perl5/site_perl/5.16.3';

if you used the first method or

use lib '/home/lib';

if you used the second method. By doing this, the installed modules are found by your program. To run the runDiscovery.pl program, you would need to do

perl -I/home/lib/perl5/site_perl/5.16.3 runDiscovery.pl

or

perl -I/home/lib

Of course, you could also add the 'use lib' line to the top of the program yourself, but you might not want to do that. You will need to replace 5.8.3 with whatever version of Perl you are using. The preceding instructions should be sufficient for standard and slightly non-standard installations. However, if you need to modify other makefile options you should look at the ExtUtils::MakeMaker documentation. Modifying other makefile options is not recommended unless you really, absolutely, and completely know what you're doing!

NOTE: If one (or more) of the tests run by 'make test' fails, you will see a summary of the tests that failed, followed by a message of the form "make: *** [test_dynamic] Error Y" where Y is a number between 1 and 255 (inclusive). If the number is less than 255, then it indicates how many test failed (if more than 254 tests failed, then 254 will still be shown). If one or more tests died, then 255 will be shown. For more details, see:

=head2 Stage 4: Create an co-occurrence matrix

assocLBD requires that a co-occurrence matrix of CUIs has been created. This matrix is stored as a flat file, in a sparse matrix format such that each line contains three tab seperated values, cui_1, cui_2, n_11 = the  count of their co-occurrences. Any matrix with that format is acceptable, however the intended method of matrix generation is to convert a UMLS::Association database into a flat matrix file. These databases are created using the CUICollector tool of UMLS::Association, and are run over the MetaMapped Medline baseline. With that file, run  utils/datasetCreator/fromMySQL/dbToTab.pl to convert the desired database into a matrix file. Notice that code in dbToTab.pl is just a sample mysql command. If the input database is created in another method, a different  command may be needed. As long as the resulting co-occurrence matrix is in the correct format LBD may be run on it. This allows flexibility in where co-occurrence information comes from.
    
Note: utils/datasetCreator/fromMySQL/removeQuotes.pl may need to be run on the resulting tab seperated file, if quotes are inlcuded in the resulting co-ocurrence matrix file.

=head2 Stage 5: Set up Dummy UMLS::Association Database

UMLS::Association requires that a database can be connected to that is in the correct format. Although this database is not required for assocLBD (since co-occurrence data is loaded from a co-occurrence matrix), it is required to run UMLS:Association. If you ran UMLS::Association to generate a co-occurrence matrix, you should be fine. Otherwise you will need to create a dummy database that it can connect to. This can be done in a few steps:

1) open mysql
     type mysql at the terminal

2) create the default database in the correct format, type:
     CREATE DATABASE cuicounts;
     use cuicounts;
     CREATE TABLE N_11(cui_1 CHAR(10), cui_2 CHAR(10), n_11 BIGINT(20));
